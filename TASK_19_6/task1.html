        Contrary to <mark class="mark"> <b>popular belief</b> </mark>, Lorem
        Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
        Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
        McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
        looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem
        Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the
        <mark class="aldo"> <b>classical</b> </mark>word in classical
        literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from
        sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The
        Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,here are many variations of
        passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered
        alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which
        don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage
        of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing
        hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the
        Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the
        first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of ove r 200
        Latin words, combind ewith a
        <mark class="ard"> <b>combind</b> </mark>handful of model sentence
        structures, to generate Lorem written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise
        on the theory of ethics, very popular during the R. enaissance. The
        first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a
        line in section 1.10.32.
